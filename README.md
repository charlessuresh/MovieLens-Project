# MovieLens-Project
MovieLens Project - HarvardX PH125.9x

For this project, you will be creating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the dslabs package (which was used for some of the exercises in PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. You can find the entire latest MovieLens dataset here. You will be creating your own recommendation system using all the tools we have shown you throughout the courses in this series. We will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.

You will use the following code to generate your datasets. Develop your algorithm using the edx set. For a final test of your algorithm, predict movie ratings in the validation set as if they were unknown. RMSE will be used to evaluate how close your predictions are to the true values in the validation set.

Also remember that by accessing this site, you are agreeing to the terms of the edX Honor Code.
